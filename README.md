# Evolus-Pencil-HTML-Export-Template
==================================

An Evolus Pencil(http://pencil.evolus.vn/) HTML Export Template developed to simplify the viewing of your finished wireframes.

It mimics a bit the functionality of the first version if Axure html formats and uses jQuery (albeit, an old version - 1.3.2).

### Features:
 * View content 1 page at a time. 
 * Side navigation for pages in the left. 
 * Bottom bar for page notes always visible


### Based on:
 * jQuery template by Maxime Delorme
 * Pretotype template by Rudy Lattae



This is my first work on Evolus Pencil (was asked to create wireframes for a client) and being a developer, I could not help but tinker a bit with the export functionality. 

Was a nice experience and will most probably enhance this plugin/template when I've got more time.
